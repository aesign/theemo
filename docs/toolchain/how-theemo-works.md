title: How Theemo Works

Theemo will work with **tokens**, passes them around from one tool to the other,
but it _will never understand_ them.

Example:

You will use tokens in figma, the way designers intend to. Next is to describe
in Theemo what's their structure, how they are classified in order to prepare
them to move them forward. You can think of it as the DSL to your tokens.

That most likely affects the [sync](sync.md) part.
